description         Java library for XML entity resolution
long_description    It is very common for web resources to be related to other resources. These \
                    relationships are expressed using URIs, most often URLs. Relying on URLs to \
                    directly identify resources to be retrieved often causes problems for end \
                    users. One way to avoid these problems is to use an entity resolver (a standard \
                    part of SAX) or a URI Resolver (a standard part of JAXP). A resolver can examine \
                    the URIs of the resources being requested and determine how best to satisfy \
                    those requests. The best way to make this function in an interoperable way is to \
                    define a standard format for mapping system identifiers and URIs. These "catalog \
                    files" can be used to map public and system identifiers and other URIs to local \
                    files (or just other URIs). The XML Commons Resolver classes greatly simplify \
                    the task of using catalog files to perform entity resolution.
